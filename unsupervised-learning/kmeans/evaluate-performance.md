Cross tabulation (You need a classifier)

```python
# Create a KMeans model with 3 clusters: model
model = KMeans(n_clusters=3)

# Use fit_predict to fit model and obtain cluster labels: labels
labels = model.fit_predict(samples)

# Create a DataFrame with labels and varieties as columns: df
df = pd.DataFrame({'labels': labels, 'varieties': varieties})

# Create crosstab: ct
ct = pd.crosstab(df["labels"], df["varieties"])

# Display ct
print(ct)

```

Inertia 
* Distance between the centroid and the elements in the cluster
* lower is better
* you can use  a line plot to visualize how the model improves with more clusters. It's key to find a balance in that trade off. We want a low inertia with not many groups

```python
ks = range(1, 6)
inertias = []

for k in ks:
    # Create a KMeans instance with k clusters: model
    model = KMeans(n_clusters = k)
    
    # Fit model to samples
    model.fit(samples)
    
    # Append the inertia to the list of inertias
    inertias.append(model.inertia_)
    
# Plot ks vs inertias
plt.plot(ks, inertias, '-o')
plt.xlabel('number of clusters, k')
plt.ylabel('inertia')
plt.xticks(ks)
plt.show()

```
