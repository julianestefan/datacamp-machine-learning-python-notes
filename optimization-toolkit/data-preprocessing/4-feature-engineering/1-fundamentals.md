# Feature Engineering Fundamentals

Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy on unseen data.

## Importance of Feature Engineering

- **Improves model performance**: Well-designed features can capture important patterns that algorithms might miss
- **Reduces complexity**: Simplifies the model by embedding domain knowledge in features
- **Enhances interpretability**: Meaningful features make model predictions easier to understand
- **Accelerates training**: Better features can lead to faster convergence
- **Maximizes information extraction**: Gets more value from limited data

## The Feature Engineering Process

Feature engineering follows these typical steps:

1. **Understand the problem and data**:
   - Define the prediction task clearly
   - Identify which variables might be informative
   - Consider what domain knowledge can guide feature creation

2. **Explore relationships in the data**:
   - Analyze correlations between features
   - Identify patterns and structures in the data
   - Detect outliers and anomalies

3. **Brainstorm new features**:
   - Apply domain knowledge to create meaningful transformations
   - Consider combinations of existing features
   - Derive new representations that might better capture underlying patterns

4. **Select and implement transformations**:
   - Choose appropriate methods for feature creation
   - Implement the transformations systematically
   - Create maintainable code for production environments

5. **Evaluate impact**:
   - Test whether new features improve model performance
   - Compare feature importance metrics
   - Iterate based on results

## Types of Feature Engineering

### Feature Transformation

Converting existing features into more useful forms:

- **Scaling**: Normalizing or standardizing numerical features
- **Log/Power transformations**: Handling skewed distributions
- **Binning**: Converting continuous variables to categorical
- **Encoding**: Converting categorical variables to numerical

### Feature Creation

Generating entirely new features:

- **Interaction terms**: Capturing relationships between features
- **Polynomial features**: Representing non-linear relationships
- **Aggregation features**: Summarizing groups of data
- **Domain-specific features**: Embedding expert knowledge

### Feature Extraction

Deriving features from complex data types:

- **Text**: Vectorization, topic modeling, sentiment analysis
- **Images**: Color histograms, edge detection, deep features
- **Time series**: Temporal patterns, seasonality, trends
- **Geospatial**: Distance calculations, clustering, regions

### Feature Selection

Choosing the most relevant features:

- **Filter methods**: Statistical measures of feature relevance
- **Wrapper methods**: Model-based selection strategies
- **Embedded methods**: Selection as part of model training

## Common Feature Engineering Techniques

### Mathematical Transformations

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')

# Logarithmic transformation (for right-skewed data)
df['log_income'] = np.log1p(df['income'])  # log1p handles zeros

# Square root transformation (less aggressive than log)
df['sqrt_distance'] = np.sqrt(df['distance'])

# Power transformation
df['squared_age'] = df['age'] ** 2

# Reciprocal transformation
df['inverse_value'] = 1 / (df['value'] + 1)  # Adding 1 to handle zeros
```

### Creating Interaction Features

```python
# Multiplication interaction
df['height_weight_interaction'] = df['height'] * df['weight']

# Division interaction (features must be strictly positive)
df['efficiency_ratio'] = df['output'] / df['input']

# Sum interaction
df['total_expense'] = df['food_expense'] + df['housing_expense'] + df['transport_expense']

# Difference interaction
df['profit_margin'] = df['revenue'] - df['cost']

# Boolean interactions
df['has_both_features'] = (df['feature_a'] == 1) & (df['feature_b'] == 1)
```

### Binning Techniques

```python
# Equal-width binning
df['age_bin_equal_width'] = pd.cut(df['age'], bins=5, labels=['Very Young', 'Young', 'Middle', 'Senior', 'Elderly'])

# Equal-frequency binning (quantiles)
df['income_quantile'] = pd.qcut(df['income'], q=4, labels=['Low', 'Medium', 'High', 'Very High'])

# Custom binning
custom_bins = [-np.inf, 0, 18, 35, 50, 65, np.inf]
custom_labels = ['Invalid', 'Child', 'Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Middle Aged', 'Senior']
df['age_group'] = pd.cut(df['age'], bins=custom_bins, labels=custom_labels)
```

### Creating Features from Datetime

```python
# Convert string to datetime
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date_column'])

# Extract basic components
df['year'] = df['date'].dt.year
df['month'] = df['date'].dt.month
df['day'] = df['date'].dt.day
df['dayofweek'] = df['date'].dt.dayofweek  # 0=Monday, 6=Sunday
df['quarter'] = df['date'].dt.quarter

# Create business day indicator
df['is_weekday'] = df['dayofweek'].isin([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]).astype(int)

# Create cyclical features for month (to preserve ordering relationship)
df['month_sin'] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * df['month'] / 12)
df['month_cos'] = np.cos(2 * np.pi * df['month'] / 12)

# Time-based features
df['days_since_first_date'] = (df['date'] - df['date'].min()).dt.days
```

## Feature Engineering Best Practices

1. **Start with domain knowledge**: Use industry expertise to guide feature creation

2. **Simple before complex**: Begin with basic transformations before trying more complex ones

3. **One transformation at a time**: Add features incrementally to measure their impact

4. **Validate with visualization**: Visualize new features to ensure they make sense

5. **Test for improvement**: Measure model performance with and without new features

6. **Document your process**: Record transformations and rationale for future reference

7. **Consider scalability**: Ensure feature engineering can be applied to new data in production

8. **Balance coverage vs. complexity**: More features aren't always better

9. **Watch for leakage**: Ensure features don't inadvertently include target information

10. **Consider interpretability**: Balance performance gains against explainability

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Feature explosion**: Creating too many features, leading to the curse of dimensionality
- **Redundant features**: Creating highly correlated features that add no value
- **Data leakage**: Inadvertently including information not available at prediction time
- **Overfitting to training data**: Creating features that work well on training but not test data
- **Undocumented transformations**: Failing to record feature engineering steps for reproducibility
- **Computational inefficiency**: Creating features that are too expensive to compute in production

## Feature Engineering Workflow Example

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Split data before feature engineering to prevent leakage
X = df.drop('target', axis=1)
y = df['target']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Base features - track performance without feature engineering
base_model = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42)
base_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
base_pred = base_model.predict(X_test)
base_rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, base_pred))
print(f"Base RMSE: {base_rmse:.4f}")

# Apply feature engineering to training data
X_train_eng = X_train.copy()
X_test_eng = X_test.copy()

# Create new features
X_train_eng['log_feature'] = np.log1p(X_train['numeric_feature'])
X_test_eng['log_feature'] = np.log1p(X_test['numeric_feature'])

X_train_eng['interaction'] = X_train['feature_a'] * X_train['feature_b']
X_test_eng['interaction'] = X_test['feature_a'] * X_test['feature_b']

# Train model with engineered features
eng_model = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42)
eng_model.fit(X_train_eng, y_train)
eng_pred = eng_model.predict(X_test_eng)
eng_rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, eng_pred))
print(f"Engineered RMSE: {eng_rmse:.4f}")
print(f"Improvement: {(base_rmse - eng_rmse) / base_rmse * 100:.2f}%")

# Examine feature importance
feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({
    'Feature': X_train_eng.columns,
    'Importance': eng_model.feature_importances_
}).sort_values('Importance', ascending=False)

print("\nFeature Importance:")
print(feature_importance.head(10))
```
