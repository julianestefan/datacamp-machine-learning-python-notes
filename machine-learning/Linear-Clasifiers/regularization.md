Logistic regression

C is the param to handle it . 
Regularization penalize big coefficients
more regularization lower training accuracy but improve test accuracy 

L1 Lasso. It makes feature selection for us
L2 Ridge. IT just shrink coefficients

Compare different C values in a chart

```python
# Train and validaton errors initialized as empty list
train_errs = list()
valid_errs = list()

# Loop over values of C_value
for C_value in [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000]:
    # Create LogisticRegression object and fit
    lr = LogisticRegression(C=C_value)
    lr.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Evaluate error rates and append to lists
    train_errs.append( 1.0 - lr.score(X_train, y_train) )
    valid_errs.append( 1.0 - lr.score(X_valid, y_valid) )
    
# Plot results
plt.semilogx(C_values, train_errs, C_values, valid_errs)
plt.legend(("train", "validation"))
plt.show()
```
Too much regularization (small C) doesn't work well - due to underfitting - and too little regularization (large C) doesn't work well either - due to overfitting.

How to get the best value of C

```python
# Specify L1 regularization
lr = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear', penalty='l1')

# Instantiate the GridSearchCV object and run the search
searcher = GridSearchCV(lr, {'C':[0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10]})
searcher.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Report the best parameters
print("Best CV params", searcher.best_params_)

# Find the number of nonzero coefficients (selected features)
best_lr = searcher.best_estimator_
print(best_lr)
coefs = best_lr.coef_
print("Total number of features:", coefs.size)
print("Number of selected features:", np.count_nonzero(coefs))
````

Get most postive and the more negative coefs

```
# Get the indices of the sorted cofficients
inds_ascending = np.argsort(lr.coef_.flatten()) 
inds_descending = inds_ascending[::-1]

# Print the most positive words
print("Most positive words: ", end="")
for i in range(5):
    print(vocab[inds_descending[i]], end=", ")
print("\n")

# Print most negative words
print("Most negative words: ", end="")
for i in range(5):
    print(vocab[inds_ascending[i]], end=", ")
print("\n")
```

Smaller values of C lead to less confident predictions. That's because smaller C means more regularization, which in turn means smaller coefficients, which means raw model outputs closer to zero and, thus, probabilities closer to 0.5 after the raw model output is squashed through the sigmoid function.
