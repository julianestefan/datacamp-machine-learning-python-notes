## Resources

The `assets` folder contains diagrams, illustrations, and other visual resources to help understand deep learning concepts.

## Purpose

These notes serve as a reference for deep learning concepts, architectures, and implementation details. They're designed to be comprehensive while still being accessible, with code examples to demonstrate practical implementation.

## Usage

The notes can be used as:
- A reference guide for deep learning concepts
- Implementation examples for PyTorch
- A study resource for deep learning techniques
- A lookup for best practices in neural network design and training

Each file is structured to build on the knowledge from previous sections, but they can also be referenced independently based on specific needs.
