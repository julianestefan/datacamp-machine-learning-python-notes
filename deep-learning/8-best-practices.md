# Deep Learning Best Practices

This document covers best practices for designing, training, and deploying deep learning models.

## Model Design Best Practices

### Architecture Selection
- Choose the right architecture for your problem (CNNs for image data, RNNs/Transformers for sequential data)
- Start with simpler architectures before moving to complex ones
- Consider computational constraints early in the design process

### Layer Design
- Use an appropriate number of layers (avoid too shallow or too deep networks)
- Choose appropriate layer sizes based on available data
- Consider skip/residual connections for deeper networks

### Activation Functions
- ReLU is a good default choice for hidden layers
- Consider Leaky ReLU to prevent dying neurons
- Use sigmoid for binary classification outputs
- Use softmax for multi-class classification outputs

## Training Best Practices

### Data Preparation
- Normalize inputs to have zero mean and unit variance
- Use appropriate data augmentation techniques
- Split data properly into training, validation, and test sets
- Handle imbalanced datasets appropriately

### Hyperparameter Selection
- Use learning rate schedulers (cosine annealing, reduce on plateau)
- Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Use appropriate batch sizes for your hardware
- Consider weight decay for regularization

### Monitoring
- Track both training and validation metrics
- Monitor gradient norms during training
- Use tools like TensorBoard or Weights & Biases for visualization
- Save checkpoints regularly

## Deployment Best Practices

### Model Optimization
- Use quantization for smaller model footprint
- Consider pruning to remove unnecessary connections
- Export to optimized formats (ONNX, TorchScript)

### Serving
- Batch inference requests when possible
- Use appropriate hardware accelerators (GPU, TPU)
- Monitor performance metrics in production
- Implement A/B testing for model updates

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Overfitting on small datasets
- Data leakage between train and validation sets
- Inappropriate learning rates
- Not handling imbalanced classes
- Poor initialization strategies
- Ignoring gradient issues (vanishing/exploding)
- Inadequate regularization

## Debugging Strategies

- Overfit a small subset first
- Gradually increase model complexity
- Test with synthetic data
- Use gradient checking
- Visualize layer activations and gradients
